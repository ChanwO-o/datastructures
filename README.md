# HashMap implementation in C++
HashMap data structure built in my ICS45c course at UC Irvine.

The goal of this project was to construct the base functionality of a hash map using characteristics of C++.

- Overloaded Constructors and Destructor
- Operator overloading
- Increase/decrease bucket size based on load factor
- Allocate & deallocate memory accordingly
- Write unit tests to confirm accuracy of each implemented method
