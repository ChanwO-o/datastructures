# Data structure implementations in C++

A collection of Data Structures built in my data structures and C++ course at UC Irvine.

The goal of these projects was to construct the base functionality of each data structure using characteristics of C++.

- Overloaded Constructors and Destructor
- Operator overloading
- Increase/decrease bucket size based on load factor
- Allocate & deallocate memory accordingly
- Write unit tests to confirm accuracy of each implemented method
